A webserver has been developed and ansible was used to automate this. This works as expected, so when you type localhost:8080 into a web browser the site is displayed

Docker was the used in order to automate the process of creating a container, in which the ansible script can be run

Vagrent was then used in order to automate the process of providing a virtual enviorment and the runs the docker script.

In order to run the file Vagrent up can be used


Issues:
the webserver works as expected with ansible, and docker, however with Vagrent the ansible is unable to find local host.

all together have spend nearly 15 hours on this exercse and have enjoyed doing so however due to time constraints was unable to complete it successfully. Although I am greatful for the provided extention.
